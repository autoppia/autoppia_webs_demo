echo "============================================"
echo ""

echo "✅ 2-Line Header Implementation:"
echo "   • Restored main navigation bar (white background)"
echo "   • Restored secondary navigation bar (blue background)"
echo "   • Both lines are clearly visible in all layouts"
echo "   • Content below headers is clearly visible"
echo "   • Proper spacing prevents content overlap"

echo "📋 Header Structure:"
echo "   Line 1: Main Navigation (Logo, Search, User Account, Cart)"
echo "   Line 2: Secondary Navigation (All, Rufus, Today's Deals, etc.)"

echo "📏 Header Heights:"
echo "   • Standard layouts: ~96px total (64px main + 32px secondary)"
echo "   • Floating navbar: ~64px (main nav only)"
echo "   • Hidden navbar: ~16px (minimal padding)"
echo "   • Side navbar: ~96px (both lines in side position)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Test Instructions:"
echo "   1. Start dev server: npm run dev"
echo "   2. Visit each URL above"
echo "   3. Verify both header lines are visible"
echo "   4. Check that content is not hidden"
echo "   5. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes"
echo ""

echo "📱 Responsive Testing:"
echo "   • Desktop: Both lines should be fully visible"
echo "   • Tablet: Both lines should be visible, may wrap"
echo "   • Mobile: Header should adapt but maintain 2-line structure"
