echo "🔄 Seed Layout Repetition Implementation"
echo "========================================"
echo ""

echo "📋 Request: Seeds 160-170 should use the same layout as seed 80"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Layout Analysis:"
echo "   • Seed 80 → Layout 3 (Search-focused)"
echo "   • Seeds 160-170 → Now also Layout 3 (Search-focused)"
echo ""

echo "✅ Changes Applied:"
echo "   • Added special case logic for seeds 160-170"
echo "   • Refactored code to use getLayoutByIndex() function"
echo "   • Seeds 160-170 now return Layout 3 instead of Layout 6"
echo ""

echo "🎨 Layout 3 - Search-focused Configuration:"
echo "   • headerOrder: ['search', 'logo', 'nav']"
echo "   • searchPosition: 'full-width'"
echo "   • navbarStyle: 'top'"
echo "   • contentGrid: 'wide'"
echo "   • cardLayout: 'masonry'"
echo "   • buttonStyle: 'outlined'"
echo "   • footerStyle: 'expanded'"
echo "   • spacing: 'normal'"
echo "   • borderRadius: 'small'"
echo "   • colorScheme: 'accent'"
echo ""

echo "📋 Test URLs:"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Original Layout (Seed 80):"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=80"
echo "   Layout: Search-focused (Layout 3)"
echo ""

echo "🎯 New Repetition (Seeds 160-170):"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=160"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=161"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=162"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=163"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=164"

echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=166"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=167"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=168"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=169"
echo "   URL: http://localhost:8002/?seed=170"
echo "   Layout: Search-focused (Layout 3) - Same as seed 80"
echo ""

echo "🔍 What to Check:"
echo "   ✅ Seeds 160-170 now show Layout 3 (Search-focused)"
echo "   ✅ Layout matches exactly with seed 80"
echo "   ✅ Search bar is full-width and positioned first"
echo "   ✅ Header order: Search → Logo → Nav"
echo "   ✅ Content uses wide grid and masonry cards"
echo "   ✅ Buttons are outlined style"
echo "   ✅ Footer is expanded"
echo "   ✅ Color scheme is accent"
echo ""

echo "📊 Before vs After:"
echo "   Before: Seeds 160-170 → Layout 6 (Floating Header)"
echo "   After:  Seeds 160-170 → Layout 3 (Search-focused)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Test Instructions:"
echo "   1. Start dev server: npm run dev"
echo "   2. Visit seed 80 to see the reference layout"
echo "   3. Visit seeds 160-170 to verify they match"
echo "   4. Compare the layouts side by side"
echo "   5. Verify all layout characteristics match"
echo ""

echo "⚠️  Note: This change affects the original mapping:"
echo "   • Seeds 160-170 no longer use Layout 6 (Floating Header)"
echo "   • They now use Layout 3 (Search-focused) instead"
echo "   • This creates a repetition of Layout 3 in the seed range"
