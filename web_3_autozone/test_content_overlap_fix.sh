echo "=========================================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Problematic Seed Values Fixed:"
echo "   • Seed 160, 170, 180 → Layout 6 (Floating Header)"
echo "   • Seed 200, 210 → Layout 7 (Hidden Navigation)"  
echo "   • Seed 260, 270 → Layout 9 (Side Navigation)"
echo ""

echo "✅ Fixes Applied:"
echo ""

echo "🎨 Layout 6 - Floating Header (seeds 160, 170, 180):"
echo "   • Changed body padding from pt-4 to pt-20"
echo "   • Reason: Floating navbar still takes up space, needs proper clearance"
echo "   • Test URLs:"
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=160"
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=170" 
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=180"
echo ""

echo "🎨 Layout 7 - Hidden Navigation (seeds 200, 210):"
echo "   • Changed body padding from pt-8 to pt-20"
echo "   • Reason: Header still exists even when nav is hidden, needs proper clearance"
echo "   • Test URLs:"
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=200"
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=210"
echo ""

echo "🎨 Layout 9 - Side Navigation (seeds 260, 270):"
echo "   • Kept body padding at pt-24 (already correct)"
echo "   • Reason: Side navbar height h-24 matches body padding pt-24"
echo "   • Test URLs:"
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=260"
echo "     - http://localhost:8002/?seed=270"
echo ""

echo "📏 Updated Padding Values:"
echo "   • navbar-floating: pt-20 (80px) - was pt-4 (16px)"
echo "   • navbar-hidden-top: pt-20 (80px) - was pt-8 (32px)"
echo "   • navbar-side: pt-24 (96px) - unchanged (was already correct)"
echo "   • navbar-top: pt-24 (96px) - unchanged (was already correct)"
echo ""

echo "🔍 What to Check:"
echo "   ✅ Content is no longer hidden behind headers"
echo "   ✅ Proper spacing between header and content"
echo "   ✅ All navigation elements are visible"
echo "   ✅ Page content starts below the header"
echo "   ✅ No overlap or clipping issues"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Test Instructions:"
echo "   1. Start dev server: npm run dev"
echo "   2. Visit each problematic seed URL above"
echo "   3. Verify content is clearly visible"
echo "   4. Check that headers don't overlap content"
echo "   5. Test on different screen sizes"
echo ""

echo "📱 Additional Testing:"
echo "   • Test all other seed values to ensure no regression"
echo "   • Verify responsive behavior on mobile/tablet"
echo "   • Check that all layout variations still work correctly"
