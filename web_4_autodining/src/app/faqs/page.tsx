    {
      question: "I didn't receive a confirmation email",

    {
      question: "How are restaurants selected?",
      answer: "We carefully curate our restaurant listings based on quality, customer reviews, and dining experience. All restaurants go through a vetting process to ensure they meet our standards.",
